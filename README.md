## 📌 Project Objective

The goal is to create an intelligent system that can:
- Detect and recognize signs from short video sequences.
- Translate sign gestures into readable text.
- Support real-time predictions using webcam feed.

This tool aims to assist medical workers and other service providers in effectively communicating with members of the deaf community in South Sudan.
